[1\. How should the tool be used?](javascript:toggleElement('helptable'))

<div id="helptable" style="display:none">

The tool can be used in many different ways depending on the aims of the user. The tool is primarily designed to be used interactively. By switching between different scenarios, for example, one can see how the distribution of cycling can be expected to change as cycling grows. By switching between line types, you can see whether or not 'desire lines' of high demand are supplied with quiet and direct routes.

By experimenting with the 'Freeze lines' option and zooming into specific areas of interest, the level of cycling at more local levels can be explored. By setting the basemap to 'Satellite' and zooming in, space available create space for cycling can be seen.

The PCT works on a region-by-region basis. The url corresponds to the region you are looking at, which can be selected from the
 <a target="_blank" href="http://pct.bike">home page</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://pct.bike/west-yorkshire/">pct.bike/west-yorkshire/</a>,
for example, shows West Yorkshire. If you move the map's extent outside the region's boundary, the PCT will jump to a new region.

Overall, there are many ways that the tool can be used to improve cycling provision. It is likely that more features will be added in future versions The table below explains the various options in the interactive map.

Taking population increases and trip rate decreases into account, the target implies doubling the proportion of trips made by cycling nationwide. Trips that have a large distances or that already have a high rate of cycling will see cycling increase less than two-fold; trips with a below average current rate of cycling but high potential (based on the distance) will see cycling increase more than two-fold.

[2\. Does hilliness matter for cycling? Do the Dutch just cycle more because the Netherlands is flatter?](javascript:toggleElement('a1'))

<div id="a1" style="display:none">

Hilliness is certainly an important predictor of cycling levels in England, with the probability of cycling a trip falling steadily as the hilliness of the local area increases (Figure 1). Overall, people in the tenth of the population in the flattest areas are three times more likely to cycle a trip than the tenth of people in the hilliest areas (2.8% trips cycled vs 0.8%).

</div>

It is also true that the Netherlands is a flatter country than England. As illustrated in Figure 2, around 80% of people in the Netherlands live in areas that are below the 20th centile for local hilliness in England. Under 4% of people in the Netherlands in live in areas that are above the 50th centile for hilliness in England. Note that in both England and the Netherlands the local area is defined using administrative areas designed to contain populations of around 1500 individuals.

</div>

We estimated what would happen to cycling levels in England if England had the same flat topography as the Netherlands (but the existing infrastructure, travel patterns and cycling cultures). We did this by re-weighting the cycle mode share shown in Figure 1 according to the Dutch distribution of hilliness shown in Figure 2 i.e. giving much more weight to the cycling levels of those living in the flattest parts of England than those living in the hilliest parts. In this "Dutch levels of hilliness" scenario, the proportion of trips cycled in England rose from 1.7% to 2.6%. This is still ten times lower than the mode share of 26.7% actually observed in the Netherlands. So although hilliness does explain a small part of why the English cycle less than the Dutch, it still leaves a massive difference unexplained. Or to put it another way, only if cycling levels in England were increased ten-fold would "the Netherlands is flatter" become a convincing excuse for England lagging behind.  

</div>

[3\. How does propensity to cycle differ between England and the Netherlands?](javascript:toggleElement('a2'))

<div id="a2" style="display:none">

People in the Netherlands make 26.7% of trips by bicycle, fifteen times higher than the figure of 1.7% in England. In addition, cycling in England is skewed towards younger, male cyclists (Figure 1A). By contrast in the Netherlands cycling remains common into older age, and women are in fact slightly more likely to cycle than men (Figure 1B). This means that the difference between England and the Netherlands is particularly large for women and older people (Figure 2). For example, whereas the cycle mode share is ‘only’ six times higher in the Netherlands than in England for men in their thirties, it is over 20 times higher for women in their thirties or men in their seventies and eighties. For women in their seventies and eighties, the cycle mode share is over 60 times higher in the Netherlands than in England.

</div>

In both countries, the probability of cycling falls rapidly as trip distance increases. Interestingly, the shape of this distance decay relationship is generally similar between the two countries (Figure 3). In other words, the Dutch achieve their higher cycling levels by boosting the relative probability that trips of all distances will be made by bicycle. This indicates that the potential to increase cycling levels in England exists for longer trips (≥ 10km) as well as for the shorter trips that are more often targeted in cycling interventions, perhaps through improved infrastructure or a more widespread adoption of electric cycles. The only noticeable difference between England and the Netherlands is that the Dutch are relatively more likely to cycle short trips ≤ 1.5 miles than the English. Plausibly, this reflects trips being cycled in the Netherlands that are more often walked in England.

[4\. Why focus on the direct routes?](javascript:toggleElement('a3'))

<div id="a3" style="display:none">

We give users the option of seeing either the 'direct' or the 'direct' the 'quietest' routes on the map. Which might people use? These routes come from the journey planner Cyclestreets.net, which helps people plan their cycling route.
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/help/howitworks/">CycleStreets.net</a>
shows three types of route, 'direct', 'balanced', and 'quietest'. Many cyclists currently choose to take a quieter route at the cost of extra time because often the shortest route involves sharing with motor traffic on busy roads. However, even the quieter routes can still involve negotiating busy roads at times. The aim of the NPCT is not to predict exactly where people are currently cycling. Rather we are trying to prioritise where to put new infrastructure.

For many people, cycling with busy traffic is hugely off-putting. A systematic review carried out for this project found this particularly puts off women, and probably also older people and those riding with children.

So are the quietest routes for those groups, and the direct routes for others? No, because this project also shows that propensity to cycle declines more rapidly with distance for women and older people. If a quieter route creates a detour such that a 2 mile trip becomes effectively a 3 mile trip, younger men’s propensity to cycle the route will decrease 11%. But for younger women, the decline is 19%, and for older adults (60+) the propensity would decrease by 35%.

This hits women’s and older men’s cycling twice: they are less likely than men to want to cycle the direct route, but then are also less likely to be willing to cycle an effectively longer alternative route. It’s likely to be part of the reason for disparities in cycling by age and gender.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center">

<table cellpadding="5" align="center" border="0" width="70%">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td align="center" valign="center">[![](/www/img/help/Route.png)](/www/img/help/Route.png "Direct and Quiet Routes between two zones.")   
</td>

</tr>

<tr class="caption">

<td align="center" valign="center">**Figure 1: Direct and Quiet Routes between two zones.**</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

</div>

Instead, for utility trips, improving direct routes will reduce safety and time disincentives to cycling. So while a good proportion of current cyclists may use the 'quietest' route, a big increase in capacity will likely necessitate substantial improvements to the 'direct' route, which will then carry many more riders.

Thus we have chosen to present the 'direct' as the most first choice for creating good cycling routes.

</div>

[5\. What are the estimates of future cycling rate based on?](javascript:toggleElement('a4'))

<div id="a4" style="display:none">

The estimates of future cycling rate are based on a regression model, the results of which can be seen in the Model Output Tab.

To create different scenarios of the future, we used different distance decay curves. For the Dutch scenario, for example, we assumed that the likelihood of cycling a given distance was the same in the UK as it is in the Netherlands.

The regression model also takes hilliness into account. The output is displayed in a way that focusses on the _absolute_ rate of cycling rather than the _percentage_ who cycle in a particular area or along a particular desire line. Thus short distance trips with a currently low rate of cycling, few hills and a high number of commutes will tend to have the highest projected increase in cycling.

The tool should be used interactively. By switching between different scenarios, for example, one can see how the distribution of cycling can be expected to change as cycling grows. By switching between line types, you can see whether or not 'desire lines' of high demand are supplied with quiet and direct routes.

By experimenting with the 'Freeze lines' option and zooming into specific areas of interest, the level of cycling at more local levels can be explored. And by setting the basemap to 'Satellite' when zoomed into specific parts of the road network, the space available to create new cycle paths and car-free zones can be explored.

Overall, there are many ways that the tool can be used to improve cycling provision. It is likely that more features will be added in future versions (if you have any suggestions, please [get in touch](mailto:npct@npct.org.uk)). The table below explains the various options in the interactive map.

</div>

[6\. How to download and use the data from the PCT?](javascript:toggleElement('a5'))

<div id="a5" style="display:none">

<!-- This section is work in progress. -->

The data underlying the PCT can be downloaded by clicking on the the Lines tab. Data can be downloaded in 3 formats: 

- `.Rds`: This includes geographical and attribute data in R's native file format. After the file has been downloaded, `.Rds` files can be loaded using the R function `readRDS()`.

- `.geojson`: This is an open data format for geographical and attribute data. `.geojson` files can be opened using the open source software [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/), which can be installed for free.

- `.csv`: This is a standard format for tabular data and can be opened in standard spreadsheet programs such as [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) and Microsoft Excel.

The PCT's native file format is `.Rds` because it is fast and light. Loading these into into R is illustrated below for the lines data (called 'l.Rds') for West Yorkshire:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
desire_lines = readRDS("l.Rds")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sp) # load sp package for spatial data
plot(desire_lines)
```



For more information about using the geographic data in QGIS, please refer to the official [QGIS Training Manual](http://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/training_manual/index.html). 

</div>

[7\. How to create custom scenarios?](javascript:toggleElement('a7'))

<div id="a7" style="display:none">

To create custom scenarios you need to 'build' new input data for the PCT and have a version of the tool running on your computer (not on a remote server). The steps to install working versions of the PCT and the build scripts on your computer are well described in the README files associated with the pct-load and pct-shiny GitHub repositories. These can be seen from the NPCT team's GitHub page: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/npct">github.com/npct</a>.

To create custom scenarios, the key dataset to modify is 'l.Rds', a SpatialLinesDataFrame (an R object class) that exists in each region. In the *root directory* of the RStudio project for the `pct-load` folder (which can be opened by opening the `pct-load.Rproj` file), this could be loaded for kent, for example, with the folowing commands, resulting in the follow plot:

```{r}
library(sp) # load spatial library 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the OD-based 'desire lines' for Kent
l = readRDS("../pct-data/kent/l.Rds")
plot(l) # plot the result
```

```{r kent-l1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
l = readRDS("../../pct-data/kent/l.Rds")
plot(l)
```

By modifying the values of the variables associated with each line (e.g. `l$Bicycle`, representing the current level of cycling) in this dataset, new scenarios can be created. Let's change the Government Target scenario so that the level of cycling is proportional to the inverse of distance, minus the average hilliness of the fastest route. This contrived example could be acheived with the following command:

```{r}
l$govtarget_slc =       # modify the scenario level of cycling for Government Target
  0.5 / l$dist_fast -   # set proportional to the inverse of distance
  l$avslope / 100       # minus the average gradient (percent)
```

Now this can be plotted as follows:

```{r kent-l2}
plot(l, lwd = l$govtarget_slc)
```

We plan to add more documentation to ease the creation of locally specific scenarios and the deployment of the PCT for use in other custom regions, cities and countries where OD data is available.
